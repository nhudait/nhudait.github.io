Hello My name is Neha Hudait and I am a rising junior at the University of California, Berkeley.

I am currently pursuing a dual-degree in **Electrical Engineering & Computer Science** and **Business Administration** through the College of Engineering and Haas School of Business. I am passionate about bridging the gap between technology and accessibility, and have dedicated much of my academic and professional career towards improving accessibility to technology for every day consumers.

I am drawn to impact driven areas such as healthcare, education, and sustainable energy, more so focused on the how technology helps to develop these areas and help the under privileged. This primarily fueled my desire to help others, and ultimately became my motivation to pursue my dual-degree.

To further understand how technology impacts different types of consumers, I have declared a minor in **Global Poverty and Practice**.   

I have extensive experience in *Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics,* and *Product Management*, as demonstrated by my targeted experiences and personal projects.

I am always looking for new and exciting opportunities. Feel free to shoot me an email at [nhudait@berkeley.edu](mailto:nhudait@berkeley.edu) or <a href="https://calendy.com/hudait" target="_blank">schedule a time to meet.</a>
