# Overview
Through [Student Technology Services](https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/), I am currently a Student Helpdesk Supervisor where I oversee a team of 5-8 Student Technology Consultants (STCs) who provide frontline technical support for over 40,000 students. I am also responsible for creating training documentation for STCs during Summer, Fall, and Spring cohort training. 

Previously, I was a Student Technology Consultant where I continually assisted the student body in troubleshooting their software and hardware related issues. Additionally, I participated in trainings and professional development. However, I was promoted to Unit Supervisor in July 2020 and now serve as Student Helpdesk Supeprvisor. 

As a Student Helpdesk Supervisor, I took on leading a team of recently hired STCs and guided them through troublehshooting techniques and training. Additionally, I host weekly meetings with the STCs where I debrief with the team about any interesting cases for that week and provide support. I also provide professional development opportunities for STCs such as resume reviews and interview prep. I create and execute a 40-hour week-long training twice a year covering basic troubleshooting concepts and customer service. I also develop team-building activities to introduce the new STCs to the team and facilitate team bonding and collaboration. 

Joining Student Technology Services has been an instrumental part of my academic journey because of the impact of the work that we do. I firmly believe in the workplace values that STS provides and am thankful the the opportunity to better serve my community. In the future, I hope to provide more professional development resources and develop automated ways to ease the workload of Student Technology Consultants.
