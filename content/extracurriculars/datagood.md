# Overview
[DataGood @ Berkeley](https://datagood.berkeley.edu) is the first student-run organization striving to increase the accessibility of data science tools to students on the Berkeley campus and organizations that maximize social impact. My roommate, Saumya, and I saw a need for more visibility for data science in impact-driven fields having explored the intersection of data science and health. We wanted to take our passions to create an organization dedicated to expanding data science knowledge beyond what was taught in introductory courses such as Data 8 and Data 100.

There are vast applications of data science and it has the power to impact millions. UC Berkeley remains a leader in designing and developing a data science student experience with its curriculum coupled with research and student organizations. We wanted to leverage this passion by creating a student organization dedicated to educating and expanding opportunities in technical fields.

Founding and leading DataGood has been an eye-opening experience. Through this organization, I developed my teaching and curriculum develop skills as well as my technical skills in data science applications. I would highly encourage anyone who is interested in data science to check out DataGood!
