# Overview

During my internship at SAP, I worked with the Platform Search team on the deployment of Search 3.0, a search engine used to streamline sourcing and procurement options for small businesses that use SAP's SAAS platforms. This was my first taste of a B2B company and what it was like to deploy a product and instantaneously get feedback from consumers.

More specifically, I developed Key Performance Indicators to understand _externally_, how well the search platform was doing in aiding customers. I answered questions such as "How relevant are the search results given to customers?" and "Are customers finding the items they need in a short period of time?"

Additionally, I aimed to understand _internally_ how effective the search platform was at using SAP resources. I answered questions such as "How scalable is Search 3.0?" and "How efficient is Search 3.0 at delivering results?"

After defining these broader questions, I delved into specific metrics to assess the health of the platform. Although I am not able to publically share specifics, I've outlined some of my major takeaways from my internship below!

# Takeaways

## No two Product Managers are the same

Coming into SAP I was nervous because this was my first real experience in product management in a standard corporate setting. My previous experiences in product management had been limited to organizations on campus, campus jobs, and startups through the Berkeley Skydeck Program. As a result, I prioritized understanding what product management looked like in a corporate setting and learning what it meant to be a product manager at SAP.

Coffee chatting product managers at SAP who worked on the platform search team was extremely helpful in understanding what a product manager's day-to-day activities looked like and what they prioritized as a product manager. Each person I met was helpful and willing to give me advice on how to break into the field of product management.


Initially, I came into the internship thinking that there was only a handful of ways to ship  products. However, throughout my conversations, I learned that each product manager's style of attacking problems is different. The workflow that each one followed was unique to their style of product management. SAP's work culture embraced this individually and I was able to develop my own style of problem solving and be creative with pitching ideas and measuring success.

## Mentorship is Key

Because this was my first real exposure to product management on a corporate skill, I wanted to leverage the knowledge base that my mentor and team had. It's safe to say that during my internship, I learned more tips and tricks for product management from quick conversations with my mentor and team as opposed to reading books and articles online. Mentorship is and remains one of the most important aspects of any internship or job opportunity -- because I had invested time in building those connections and learning, I was able to develop my skills and execute my project seamlessly.

## Zoom Fatigue is Real
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my internship was completely virtual, meaning that all meetings, socials, and events would take place on one of what seems like hundreds of virtual platforms. I think during my internship I used around 15 different video conferencing tools!

Though my commute time was significantly reduced because of the online setup, work wasnâ€™t a cakewalk. Working in the same room that I slept in made me very comfortable and it was hard to get in the mood for work. I quickly realized that online meetings were much more tiring than face-to-face ones and I was exhausted from simply staring at a screen for 40 hours in a work week. Taking breaks such as going on a walk, cooking, or doing another non-screen activity helped to build my stamina so that I was energized to tackle a meeting even if it was 5pm on a Friday.

Additionally, because of the limited human interaction, I feel I was not able to grow my professional relationships since talking was primarily limited to the project I worked on as opposed to getting to know each other. Instead, I focused on scheduling short meetings with members adjacent to my team to learn as much as I could.
