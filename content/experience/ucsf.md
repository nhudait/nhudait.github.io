# Overview
I worked with the Cardiovascular Department at the University of California San Francisco Medial Center to improve AI-enabled detection and preventuion techniques for cardiovacular disease. Currently, cardiovascular disease can be detected through different ultrasounds. However, there is a high turnaround time between completing the ultrasound, analyzing the video, and determining to what extent of severity the patient has cardiovascular dieases i.e. whether they were at risk, required medication, etc. 

To approach this problem, I looked methods to predict the next frame of an ultrasound video depending on what level of severity or cardiovascular diease a particular patient had. I then compared this predicted frame to the actual next frame of the video to determine the similarity. From here, I was able to determine what level of severity a particular patient had. I used a combination of a Long Short Term Memory  Model and Convolutional Neural Network to do achieve this. 

# Takeaways
## Data Cleaning is Essential
Data cleaning involves creating different approaches to tackling potential missing data and smoothing out any noisy data. I spent more time cleaning the datasets provided and standardizing them as opposed to developing the mode. Having well documented and thought out techniques for data cleaning and pre-processing aids in creating a model that is enabled to tackle the problem more effectively.

## Reduce the Complexity 
One of the biggest challenges I faced was overfitting due to the complexity of my model. Initially, I thought the more features I added, the more likely my model would be able to classify and create different video frames. However, I realized that overfitting was a massive roadblock in progress. Thus, I had to think critically about how I wanted to train the model and overall reduce the complexity.
