testimonial: "Alexis designed everything for Cope from the ground up. What I really like about him is his true understanding and grasp of what makes a great UI great. He knows that the user experience needs a lot of refining from customers and he isn't shy to take feedback even if it's critical. Alexis is one of those rare people who just gets it."

# Overview 
During my internship at Facebook, I worked on the People Data Privacy team to design and develop a machine learning system and baseline model to detect 20,000 privacy violations with 99.4% accuracy. Facebook has several commitments to suspend the collection of device-related data collected on its services or third-party  websites without the consent of users. PDP Privacy is part of a larger initiative to detect and prevent these privacy violations in an effort to improve overall privacy of Facebook's Family of Apps. 

PDP Privacy and Facebook as a whole is impact driven, meaning that every line of code, task, initiative, or design document is centered around generating impact for consumers. Additionally, the team had high visibility and worked with many different cross functional teams, which was a rewarding experience. I admire how hardworking, how intelligent, and how passionate everyone on my team was! 

# Takeaways

## Post Frequent Updates
My mentor pushed me to create weekly posts on my progress on my intern project and cross-share these posts across several different groups. This helped to increase the visibility of my work across the entire People Data Platform team and get quick feedback on any design decisions I needed to make. Furthermore, this allowed me to keep track of the work that I was doing, any milestones, accomplishments, and blockers. My final presentation was a combination of all of my posts into one impactful presentation. 

## Improving as a Software Engineer
Facebook's SWE internship is no joke -- it prepares you to tackle the hardest problems that the company has to solve. Throughout this internship, I increased my software engineering skills tenfold through learning different interesting technological stacks as well as improving my debugging skills. I also noticed my overall growth as a software engineer from when I first started the internship until when I ended. By the end of the internship, I was writing clean, concise, bug-free code efficiently, pushing out several code reviews per day. I also noticed that my intuition for high-level design thinking vastly improved the more I learned about what machine learning at Facebook entails. It definitely was not easy and there were many heavy coding days. However, I am thankful for the experience to learn and grow as an engineer.
