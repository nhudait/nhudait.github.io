# Overview
IEEE has been one of the most influential organizations I have joined in college. I joined IEEE my freshman year as a Professional Development committee member where I planned professional development workshops for IEEE members. Flash forward, I became Professional Development committee director and now am External Vice President of the organization!

As External Vice President, I primarily work with the external facing committees that affect IEEE's image. More specifically, I primarily work with the website, industry relations, and outreach committees. Additionally, I interface with the EE/CS department to plan and coordinate initiatives to reach out to the general EE/CS community. I work with other organizations to plan collaborative events.

Perhaps one of my favorite events which I spearhead is EECS Women's History Month. This is a month long initiative started by IEEE to celebrate women in technical fields. Through IEEE, I host tech talks, speaker panels, a hackathon, as well as several different socials. This is one of my favorite events because I love seeing the impact that this month long celebration has on the community.

I've met some of my best friends through IEEE and I'm thankful for the impact that it has had on my academic and professional career!
