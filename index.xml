      <description>Overview IEEE has been one of the most influential organizations I have joined in college. I joined IEEE my freshman year as a Professional Development committee member where I planned professional development workshops for IEEE members. Flash forward, I became Professional Development committee director and now am External Vice President of the organization!
As External Vice President, I primarily work with the external facing committees that affect IEEE&amp;rsquo;s image. More specifically, I primarily work with the website, industry relations, and outreach committees.</description>

      <description>Overview DataGood @ Berkeley is the first student-run organization striving to increase the accessibility of data science tools to students on the Berkeley campus and organizations that maximize social impact. My roommate, Saumya, and I saw a need for more visibility for data science in impact-driven fields having explored the intersection of data science and health. We wanted to take our passions to create an organization dedicated to expanding data science knowledge beyond what was taught in introductory courses such as Data 8 and Data 100.</description>

      <description>Overview During my internship at SAP, I worked with the Platform Search team on the deployment of Search 3.0, a search engine used to streamline sourcing and procurement options for small businesses that use SAP&amp;rsquo;s SAAS platforms. This was my first taste of a B2B company and what it was like to deploy a product and instantaneously get feedback from consumers.
More specifically, I developed Key Performance Indicators to understand externally, how well the search platform was doing in aiding customers.</description>
