CS 61A was the first programming class I had ever taken at Cal and served as a formal introduction to computer science. The course is structured in a way that it gives you a taste of what computer science is all about without getting into the nitty gritty details. We were able to learn Python, of course, but also learn more about other programming languages such as Scheme (very old might I add) and SQL. These allowed us to learn all the different nuances that different programming languages have, and gave a solid foundation of Python and programming skills in general.

Although this course is marked as an "introductory course," it honestly serves for all students regardless of whether they are seasoned veteran coders or simply first time coders such as myself. Although this course was difficult, in the end I was able to learn a lot not only about myself, but about computer science as a whole.

Here, I have compiled a list of the key items explored during this course. By no means is this meant to be a comprehensive guide, but rather just a way for students to make sure they are covering all of their bases.
