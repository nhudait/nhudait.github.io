**“There can be no peace without development, no development without peace, and no lasting peace or sustainable development without respect for human rights and the rule of law.” – Former UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson**

In Spring 2020, I decided I wanted to declare a minor in Global Poverty and Practice. Although I had no idea what was in store for me, I knew that I was passionate about corporate social responsibility, and the impact tech businesses have on their workers and their consumers. Consequently, I decided to take a course offered by the Haas School of Business that focused on one small facet of CSR: human rights. Although I wasn't sure what this course had in store for me, I was curious and determined to understand the current human rights context so that I may help to champion human rights efforts in the future.

This course quickly became one of my favorite courses I've taken at Cal. Roger and Faris, the instructors for the course, made the course extremely lively and discussion based. They were able to bring in their own expertise from the field to the classroom through targeted case studies, especially highlighting the human rights issues surrounding big tech companies. Although its no secret big tech has not performed their human rights due dilligence, it was more so surprising to see just to what extent big tech was ignoring human rights issues in the first place.

Below, you can find a short guide on the key take-aways from the course. This is not meant to substitute for the lecture notes and case studies from the actual course, but rather to supplement the material given and give a small sample of what this course has to offer.
