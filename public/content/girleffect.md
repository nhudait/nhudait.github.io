# Overview

![](//nehahudait.com/girleffect/img/nikegirleffect.jpg)

[Girl Effect](https://girleffect.org) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering and educating girls across the world, especially in developing countries, through Artificial Intelligence. I worked as a Software Developer for Girl Effect on their conversational AI products aimed to answer questions from girls. More specifically, I worked on Big Sis and Chhaa Jaa, Girl Effect's flagship products in the United States and India.

My work was primarily centered around improving the chatbot's functionality in understanding what the intent of the girl's message is and delivering tailored results. Through this, I primarily employed Natural Language Understanding techniques to improve the overall quality of responses for the girls.

## Springster
Springster is one of Girl Effect's mobile platforms which digitally connects marginalized and vulnerable girlsot online content designed to equip them with the knowledge, confidence, and connections they need to navigate the complex choices of adolescence. Springster publishes content co-created with and designed for girls, to build knowledge, inspire, and support girls to create positive change in their lives.

## Big Sis and Chhaa Jaa

Big Sis and Chhaa Jaa are chatbot that uses machine learning to provide girls with personalized answers to their questions on love, relationships, and sexual health, enabling girls to seek advice and find answers 24/7. Over 12.7 million unique users use these products yearly. As a result, it is important to interate upon the chatbot design to ensure that the content is factual and questions are being accurately interpreted and answered.

# The Problem
Currently, within the two chatbots, girls are able to ask questions about all things love, sex, and relationships. However, due to slang, mispellings, inaccurate translations, or other factors that can contribute to an incorrect dictionary, the chatbot has difficulty delivering catered responses.

Big Sis currently analyzes all of the text that is sent on the chatbot, identifies if there are any key words, and outputs a set of choices for the girl to select from. Chhaa Jaa adds this translation feature prior to looking at its dictionary. However this isn't necessarily sustainable and cannot deliver accurate results. For example, if a girl typed in "bf", the chatbot would not be able to recognize the keyword as "boyfriend."
