This was my first taste of a B2B company and what it was like to deploy a product and instantaneously get feedback from consumers.</p><p>More specifically, I developed Key Performance Indicators to understand <em>externally</em>, how well the search platform was doing in aiding customers. I answered questions such as &ldquo;How relevant are the search results given to customers?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Are customers finding the items they need in a short period of time?&rdquo;</p><p>Additionally, I aimed to understand <em>internally</em> how effective the search platform was at using SAP resources. I answered questions such as &ldquo;How scalable is Search 3.0?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How efficient is Search 3.0 at delivering results?&rdquo;</p><p>After defining these broader questions, I delved into specific metrics to assess the health of the platform. Although I am not able to publically share specifics, I&rsquo;ve outlined some of my major takeaways from my internship below!</p><h1 id=takeaways>Takeaways</h1><h2 id=no-two-product-managers-are-the-same>No two Product Managers are the same</h2><p>Coming into SAP I was nervous because this was my first real experience in product management in a standard corporate setting. My previous experiences in product management had been limited to organizations on campus, campus jobs, and startups through the Berkeley Skydeck Program. As a result, I prioritized understanding what product management looked like in a corporate setting and learning what it meant to be a product manager at SAP.</p><p>Coffee chatting product managers at SAP who worked on the platform search team was extremely helpful in understanding what a product manager&rsquo;s day-to-day activities looked like and what they prioritized as a product manager. Each person I met was helpful and willing to give me advice on how to break into the field of product management.</p><p>Initially, I came into the internship thinking that there was only a handful of ways to ship products. However, throughout my conversations, I learned that each product manager&rsquo;s style of attacking problems is different. The workflow that each one followed was unique to their style of product management. SAP&rsquo;s work culture embraced this individually and I was able to develop my own style of problem solving and be creative with pitching ideas and measuring success.</p><h2 id=mentorship-is-key>Mentorship is Key</h2><p>Because this was my first real exposure to product management on a corporate skill, I wanted to leverage the knowledge base that my mentor and team had. It&rsquo;s safe to say that during my internship, I learned more tips and tricks for product management from quick conversations with my mentor and team as opposed to reading books and articles online. Mentorship is and remains one of the most important aspects of any internship or job opportunity &ndash; because I had invested time in building those connections and learning, I was able to develop my skills and execute my project seamlessly.</p><h2 id=zoom-fatigue-is-real>Zoom Fatigue is Real</h2><p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my internship was completely virtual, meaning that all meetings, socials, and events would take place on one of what seems like hundreds of virtual platforms. I think during my internship I used around 15 different video conferencing tools!</p><p>Though my commute time was significantly reduced because of the online setup, work wasnâ€™t a cakewalk. Working in the same room that I slept in made me very comfortable and it was hard to get in the mood for work. I quickly realized that online meetings were much more tiring than face-to-face ones and I was exhausted from simply staring at a screen for 40 hours in a work week. Taking breaks such as going on a walk, cooking, or doing another non-screen activity helped to build my stamina so that I was energized to tackle a meeting even if it was 5pm on a Friday.</p><p>Additionally, because of the limited human interaction, I feel I was not able to grow my professional relationships since talking was primarily limited to the project I worked on as opposed to getting to know each other. Instead, I focused on scheduling short meetings with members adjacent to my team to learn as much as I could.</p></div></section><footer><div class=icons><a href=mailto:nhudait@berkeley.edu><svg width="16" height="14" viewBox="0 0 16 14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>ui-16px-1_email-84</title><defs/><g id="Portfolio" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g transform="translate(-94.000000, -336.000000)" id="Group" fill="#505050"><g transform="translate(94.000000, 335.000000)"><g id="ui-16px-1_email-84" transform="translate(0.000000, 1.000000)"><path d="M15 0H1C.448.0.0.447.0 1V13C0 13.553.448 14 1 14H15C15.552 14 16 13.553 16 13V1c0-.553-.448-1-1-1zM14 12H2V5.723L7.504 8.868C7.812 9.044 8.189 9.044 8.496 8.868L14 5.723V12zm0-8.58L8 6.849 2 3.42V2H14V3.42z" id="Shape"/></g></g></g></g></svg></a><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/nehahudait target=blank><svg width="17" height="16" viewBox="0 0 17 16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>social-16px_logo-linkedin</title><defs/><g id="Portfolio" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g transform="translate(-243.000000, -335.000000)" id="Group" fill="#505050"><g transform="translate(94.000000, 335.000000)"><g id="social-16px_logo-linkedin" transform="translate(149.000000, 0.000000)"><path d="M15.3.0H.7C.3.0.0.3.0.7V15.4C0 15.7.3 16 .7 16H15.4C15.8 16 16.1 15.7 16.1 15.3V.7C16 .3 15.7.0 15.3.0zM4.7 13.6H2.4V6H4.8v7.6H4.7zM3.6 5c-.8.0-1.4-.7-1.4-1.4.0-.8.6-1.4 1.4-1.4S5 2.8 5 3.6C4.9 4.3 4.3 5 3.6 5zm10 8.6H11.2V9.9c0-.9.0-2-1.2-2s-1.4 1-1.4 2v3.8H6.2V6H8.5V7C8.8 6.4 9.6 5.8 10.7 5.8c2.4.0 2.8 1.6 2.8 3.6v4.2H13.6z" id="Shape"/></g></g></g></g></svg></a><a href=https://github.com/nhudait target=blank><svg width="17" height="17" viewBox="0 0 17 17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>social-16px_logo-github</title><g id="Portfolio" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g id="GitHub-Mark" transform="translate(-136.000000, -55.000000)" fill="#505050"><path d="M144.319263 55.455C139.902185 55.455 136.32 59.0366937 136.32 63.4552456 136.32 66.9897924 138.612029 69.9880428 141.791009 71.0459021 142.191267 71.1195692 142.337128 70.8725389 142.337128 70.6603777 142.337128 70.4708077 142.330252 69.967416 142.326323 69.2999922 140.101086 69.7832483 139.631581 68.2273994 139.631581 68.2273994 139.267666 67.303123 138.743156 67.057075 138.743156 67.057075 138.016799 66.5610499 138.798161 66.5708722 138.798161 66.5708722 139.601132 66.6273503 140.02349 67.3954524 140.02349 67.3954524 140.737078 68.617835 141.896107 68.2647241 142.351861 68.0599296 142.424546 67.5432777 142.631305 67.1906579 142.859673 66.9907746 141.083314 66.7889268 139.215608 66.1023495 139.215608 63.0368165 139.215608 62.163616 139.527465 61.4490452 140.039206 60.8901576 139.956698 60.6878187 139.682166 59.8740429 140.117784 58.7729656c0 0 .671353000000011-.2151079 2.19969900000001.820160200000004C142.95544 59.4153426 143.640053 59.326942 144.320246 59.3235043 144.999947 59.326942 145.684069 59.4153426 146.323008 59.5931258 147.850372 58.5578577 148.520743 58.7729656 148.520743 58.7729656 148.957343 59.8740429 148.68281 60.6878187 148.600794 60.8901576 149.113517 61.4490452 149.422919 62.163616 149.422919 63.0368165c0 3.0733908-1.870653 3.74965469999999-3.65241399999999 3.9475736C146.057315 67.2314204 146.313186 67.7195876 146.313186 68.4660808 146.313186 69.5352357 146.303364 70.3981229 146.303364 70.6603777 146.303364 70.8745034 146.447751 71.1234981 146.853411 71.045411 150.029936 69.9850961 152.32 66.9888101 152.32 63.4552456 152.32 59.0366937 148.737815 55.455 144.319263 55.455" id="Fill-4"/></g></g></svg></a></div><a href=# style=color:#3a7ca5;text-decoration:underline data-scroll-goto=0>Back to top</a></footer><script src=https://nhudait.github.io/js/jquery-1.js></script><script src=https://nhudait.github.io/js/stickUp.js></script><script src=https://nhudait.github.io/js/scrollIt.js type=text/javascript></script><script type=text/javascript>jQuery(function(a){a(document).ready(function(){a('.main-navigation').stickUp({})})}),$(function(){$.scrollIt({topOffset:-70,easing:'ease-in-out'})})</script></body></html>
