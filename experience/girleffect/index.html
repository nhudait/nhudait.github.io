I worked as a Software Developer for Girl Effect on their conversational AI products aimed to answer questions from girls. More specifically, I worked on Big Sis and Chhaa Jaa, Girl Effect&rsquo;s flagship products in the United States and India.</p><p>My work was primarily centered around improving the chatbot&rsquo;s functionality in understanding what the intent of the girl&rsquo;s message is and delivering tailored results. Through this, I primarily employed Natural Language Understanding techniques to improve the overall quality of responses for the girls.</p><h2 id=springster>Springster</h2><p>Springster is one of Girl Effect&rsquo;s mobile platforms which digitally connects marginalized and vulnerable girlsot online content designed to equip them with the knowledge, confidence, and connections they need to navigate the complex choices of adolescence. Springster publishes content co-created with and designed for girls, to build knowledge, inspire, and support girls to create positive change in their lives.</p><h2 id=big-sis-and-chhaa-jaa>Big Sis and Chhaa Jaa</h2><p>Big Sis and Chhaa Jaa are chatbot that uses machine learning to provide girls with personalized answers to their questions on love, relationships, and sexual health, enabling girls to seek advice and find answers 24/7. Over 12.7 million unique users use these products yearly. As a result, it is important to interate upon the chatbot design to ensure that the content is factual and questions are being accurately interpreted and answered.</p><h1 id=the-problem>The Problem</h1><p>Currently, within the two chatbots, girls are able to ask questions about all things love, sex, and relationships. However, due to slang, mispellings, inaccurate translations, or other factors that can contribute to an incorrect dictionary, the chatbot has difficulty delivering catered responses.</p><p>Big Sis currently analyzes all of the text that is sent on the chatbot, identifies if there are any key words, and outputs a set of choices for the girl to select from. Chhaa Jaa adds this translation feature prior to looking at its dictionary. However this isn&rsquo;t necessarily sustainable and cannot deliver accurate results. For example, if a girl typed in &ldquo;bf&rdquo;, the chatbot would not be able to recognize the keyword as &ldquo;boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><h1 id=workflow>Workflow</h1><p>To approach this, I created a machine learning model to create a mapping between some of the messages that different girls submitted to the chatbot to generate relevant results. Currently,
if a girl has a specific question about a certain topic, they are able to submit that subject or ask a question to the chatbot.</p><p>The chatbot will then query it’s dictionary to find relevant questions to display based on the topic of interest. However, if the topic is misspelled or slang is used, the chatbot will not be able to understand the word and as a result, will not be able to show relevant results.</p><p>I created a model to create a mapping between some of the messages to a generated keyword. In this case, this would be a topic relating to questions that girls may have. For example, if a girl typed in “I love my boyfriend” or “I love my bf,” this would map to the topic “boyfriend.” We used a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to do this.</p><p>To create a proof of concept, I used the labels that Girl Effect currently uses for their
chatbot. Then, I generated inputs into the LSTM model. I created a list of sequences using
the entries and created a mapping from the index to character and character to the index for the
current data that I were looking at. I also created a mapping from the index to the topic
(“boyfriend”, “love”, etc.) and a mapping from the phrase to index. I finally utilized this mapping to make the LSTM input, which is the number of sequences x the number of elements
in the sequence x the number of characters in the alphabet. We then trained the LSTM model on
these inputs and made a streamlined way to predict what topic some input was related to after
training. Now, if a girl is able to enter the phrase “I love my bf” the chatbot will map this phrase to “love” or “boyfriend” and display the suggested topics.</p><h1 id=takeaways>Takeaways</h1><h2 id=translation-is-tricky>Translation is Tricky</h2><p>Translation and NLP remains a huge issue when using NLP for text in different languages. Because of the vast complexity of different languages, when doing direct translation, often times there is an associated loss. For example, idioms, irony, satire, slang etc. could be lost when doing direct translations from one language to another. As a result, using NLP techniques becomes much tricker because we want to minimize loss.</p><h2 id=verification-is-difficult>Verification is Difficult</h2><p>Because we are doing NLP on different languages, verifying our results becomes much more complex if we don&rsquo;t speak the language. I was fortunate enough to learn Hindi growing up, so I could quickly sanity check the results that I was getting from Chaa Jaa. However, my teammates really struggled with verifying results iteratively because they weren&rsquo;t as well versed in Hindi or the other languages that we were working with. When working with different languages, it&rsquo;s helpful to have native experts who can share insight on nuances and other complexities of languages.</p></div></section><footer><div class=icons><a href=mailto:nhudait@berkeley.edu><svg width="16" height="14" viewBox="0 0 16 14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>ui-16px-1_email-84</title><defs/><g id="Portfolio" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g transform="translate(-94.000000, -336.000000)" id="Group" fill="#505050"><g transform="translate(94.000000, 335.000000)"><g id="ui-16px-1_email-84" transform="translate(0.000000, 1.000000)"><path d="M15 0H1C.448.0.0.447.0 1V13C0 13.553.448 14 1 14H15C15.552 14 16 13.553 16 13V1c0-.553-.448-1-1-1zM14 12H2V5.723L7.504 8.868C7.812 9.044 8.189 9.044 8.496 8.868L14 5.723V12zm0-8.58L8 6.849 2 3.42V2H14V3.42z" id="Shape"/></g></g></g></g></svg></a><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/nehahudait target=blank><svg width="17" height="16" viewBox="0 0 17 16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>social-16px_logo-linkedin</title><defs/><g id="Portfolio" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g transform="translate(-243.000000, -335.000000)" id="Group" fill="#505050"><g transform="translate(94.000000, 335.000000)"><g id="social-16px_logo-linkedin" transform="translate(149.000000, 0.000000)"><path d="M15.3.0H.7C.3.0.0.3.0.7V15.4C0 15.7.3 16 .7 16H15.4C15.8 16 16.1 15.7 16.1 15.3V.7C16 .3 15.7.0 15.3.0zM4.7 13.6H2.4V6H4.8v7.6H4.7zM3.6 5c-.8.0-1.4-.7-1.4-1.4.0-.8.6-1.4 1.4-1.4S5 2.8 5 3.6C4.9 4.3 4.3 5 3.6 5zm10 8.6H11.2V9.9c0-.9.0-2-1.2-2s-1.4 1-1.4 2v3.8H6.2V6H8.5V7C8.8 6.4 9.6 5.8 10.7 5.8c2.4.0 2.8 1.6 2.8 3.6v4.2H13.6z" id="Shape"/></g></g></g></g></svg></a><a href=https://github.com/nhudait target=blank><svg width="17" height="17" viewBox="0 0 17 17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>social-16px_logo-github</title><g id="Portfolio" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g id="GitHub-Mark" transform="translate(-136.000000, -55.000000)" fill="#505050"><path d="M144.319263 55.455C139.902185 55.455 136.32 59.0366937 136.32 63.4552456 136.32 66.9897924 138.612029 69.9880428 141.791009 71.0459021 142.191267 71.1195692 142.337128 70.8725389 142.337128 70.6603777 142.337128 70.4708077 142.330252 69.967416 142.326323 69.2999922 140.101086 69.7832483 139.631581 68.2273994 139.631581 68.2273994 139.267666 67.303123 138.743156 67.057075 138.743156 67.057075 138.016799 66.5610499 138.798161 66.5708722 138.798161 66.5708722 139.601132 66.6273503 140.02349 67.3954524 140.02349 67.3954524 140.737078 68.617835 141.896107 68.2647241 142.351861 68.0599296 142.424546 67.5432777 142.631305 67.1906579 142.859673 66.9907746 141.083314 66.7889268 139.215608 66.1023495 139.215608 63.0368165 139.215608 62.163616 139.527465 61.4490452 140.039206 60.8901576 139.956698 60.6878187 139.682166 59.8740429 140.117784 58.7729656c0 0 .671353000000011-.2151079 2.19969900000001.820160200000004C142.95544 59.4153426 143.640053 59.326942 144.320246 59.3235043 144.999947 59.326942 145.684069 59.4153426 146.323008 59.5931258 147.850372 58.5578577 148.520743 58.7729656 148.520743 58.7729656 148.957343 59.8740429 148.68281 60.6878187 148.600794 60.8901576 149.113517 61.4490452 149.422919 62.163616 149.422919 63.0368165c0 3.0733908-1.870653 3.74965469999999-3.65241399999999 3.9475736C146.057315 67.2314204 146.313186 67.7195876 146.313186 68.4660808 146.313186 69.5352357 146.303364 70.3981229 146.303364 70.6603777 146.303364 70.8745034 146.447751 71.1234981 146.853411 71.045411 150.029936 69.9850961 152.32 66.9888101 152.32 63.4552456 152.32 59.0366937 148.737815 55.455 144.319263 55.455" id="Fill-4"/></g></g></svg></a></div><a href=# style=color:#3a7ca5;text-decoration:underline data-scroll-goto=0>Back to top</a></footer><script src=https://nhudait.github.io/js/jquery-1.js></script><script src=https://nhudait.github.io/js/stickUp.js></script><script src=https://nhudait.github.io/js/scrollIt.js type=text/javascript></script><script type=text/javascript>jQuery(function(a){a(document).ready(function(){a('.main-navigation').stickUp({})})}),$(function(){$.scrollIt({topOffset:-70,easing:'ease-in-out'})})</script></body></html>
